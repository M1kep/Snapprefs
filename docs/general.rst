	| HOW TO USE
	| To replace stickers, you have to first get SC\'s Emoji zips (can be found in their apk\'s assets
	| folder), the PNG folder stores the previews of the stickers, the SVG folder contains the actual 
	| stickers. Each filename represents the unicode code of the Emoji, which they represent. To change 
	| the sticker, you have to replace the desired PNG and SVG in their zip, then place the zips in the 
	| /SDCARD/Snapprefs/Stickers/ folder (create them). Click here for a tutorial.
	| Example SVGs/PNGs can be found at https://github.com/Ranks/emojione
