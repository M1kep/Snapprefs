Report an Issue
###############

.. warning:: Search if the issue is already opened on Github and perform a search in the XDA thread. Often an issue has been already reported
             or there is a fix / workaround available.


1. **Search** on Github and XDA if the issue is already reported properly.

2. If the issue is not yet on Github, open a Github Issue. 
	2.1 If you'e using a dev build, please report it in #issue-reporting on Slack
	
3. Provide needed information such as:
	* Snapprefs and Snapchat Version
	* Android Version
	* How is the issue reproduceable
	* Descripe the steps you are taking
	
4. *Provide Logs!* This means:
	* Use Android Studio or a Logcat App like Logcat Extreme to log only Snapchat/Snapprefs
	* Trim the log down to the error, no one has time to search through 100s lines of log.
	
5. Be sure you have everything included, if your issue is something like "herpyderp something crashes sometimes" don't be suprised if the issue gets closed.

6. "I'm having trouble with logging in to Snapchat, help Xposed is not working properly" or the steps on top are unclear and you're too lazy to use google -> wipe your phone and don't come back.
